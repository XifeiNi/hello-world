It is now recognized as the planet\u2019s largest civic event and it led to the passage of landmark environmental laws in the United States, including the Clean Air, Clear Water and Endangered Species Acts. Many countries soon adopted similar laws, and the United Nations chose Earth Day 2016 to sign the Paris climate agreement.<br/><a href=\"https://www.earthday.org/earthday/countdown-to-2020/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.earthday.org/earthday/countdown-to-2020/</a></p> <p>Questions, concerns, comments or remarks can be messaged here.<br/>Peace, Love, Crayons, Chalk &amp; Any &amp; All environmentally friendly art-making supplies!</p> <p>For Sacramento Ca please visit #CreativeToTheCore events @<br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/CreativeToTheCore/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/CreativeToTheCore/</a><br/>Contact Deidre Trudeau</p> <p>For other world locations please contact Founder - Scott Wong a.k.a. \"PSYS\"<br/>GROUP: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/floodthestreetswithart\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.facebook.com/groups/floodthestreetswithart</a></p> <p>Join in on or Create Your Own Creative Celebration Live or Virtual in the Greater Sacramento Region.

It will be for the duration of this pandemic or until it no longer seems needed.</p> <p>The purpose of this \"daily meetup\" is to keep everyone connected and to share what you are doing to get thru this challenging time.</p> <p>Feel free to share photos of scenic places you have been to or are going to during this time, poetry, inspirational secular quotes, tasteful links to jokes and utubes to uplift our spirits, recipes, exercise utubes, etc.</p> <p>Other activities we can continue to do are gardening, feeding the birds, enjoying our wildlife, star gazing, reading, online classes, dancing, drumming, chanting, singing, arts and crafts, bicycling, walks and hikes on your own and everything keeping a 6 foot social distance. Ideally the least amount of people you come into contact with the better for everyone. This is a good time to de-clutter if you have the inspiration, catch up with old friends and family by phone, letters, emails, FaceTime, etc.</p> <p>There are also volunteer opportunities but first and mostly take care of yourself and your health by washing your hands often, avoiding touching your face, using disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizers with 60% or more of alcohol, using masks and disposable gloves where there are large crowds like supermarkets. Avoid carpooling, food sharing and gathering in confined places. As many of us are in the over 60 \"kid\" crowd, we need to be especially careful as we have become \"delicate flowers\" !</p> <p>There will always be some conflicting info out there so it is always best to err on the side of caution until this passes. To a brighter tomorrow and may we share many more good times in the months and years to come! May the Force be With Us! With much love and healing wishes.</p>",

But not everyone will take the time to learn the tech tips and tricks to create a valuable viewer experience that matches their brand.</p> <p>It's clear to me that my community could use some help to get their events virtual. If I could just reach everyone at once to tell them how to translate their activities with the right equipment, then we all win.</p> <p>WHO IS TEACHING?<br/>My company, House of 8 Media, averages 40 productions a year (until now.) It's no wonder that I've been called the \"The Lens of the New Peninsula.\" There are many things I'm not great at...but one of my biggest gifts is that I'm a super-hero in the realm of TEACHING video production. I'm able to take complicated processes and break it down in a way that is easy for anyone to understand.</p> <p>For example, under my initial supervision, right now a minimal staff at the Carmel Academy of Performing Arts is able to produce multiple dance classes per day with dozens of students tuning it to take class at home. They understood the need to revaluate their service-delivery model and Get Virtual.</p> <p>WHAT IS THIS WEBINAR ABOUT?<br/>In this webinar, I will personally coach you getting started with professional-quality virtual live events (i.e. teaching/performing/fundraising/presenting online.)</p> <p>This 1-hr webinar will help you transition from live events to virtual events by filling this hour with content - not explanation. We'll cover how to achieve high creative standards, which platforms to choose, my principles of virtual meeting etiquette, and you'll leave with a bundle of .pdfs including an Expert Buyer's Guid with recommendations on which equipment to buy now:</p> <p>LET'S GET STARTED<br/>Virtual IS Real. In my opinion, it doesn\u2019t really matter if you make the time in person or at home. The biggest difference is that if there is a barrier of any kind - whether quality or how it's presented \u2013 it will keep your audience from being fully present - if at all.</p> <p>WHO IS THIS FOR?<br/>Every business owner, institution, organization, entrepreneur, or live performance is a candidate to seize the opportunity of going virtual. I know this because I\u2019m seeing it every day. I\u2019m on a mission to develop an army of first time video producers. I\u2019m actively seeking creative types to teach them everything I know, connect them with each other, and actually provide them with SOLUTIONS.</p> <p>See you on the call,<br/>Mike Buffo, The eDirector<br/>Director of Photography/Production at House of 8 Media</p>",

We will always meet at the BP gas station at 2185 W New York Ave W, FL-44, DeLand, FL 32720 (on West 44 at the roundabout). Meetup time is 5:45pm with KSU (kick stands up) at 6:00pm. Make sure you fill your tanks before the ride as we do not make any stops. Guests are always welcome, so please feel free to bring a passenger and/or other riders. This is a rain or shine event, so bring your rain gear just in case. We will cancel the ride if the weather is determined to be too dangerous for riding.</p> <p>For more information or questions, contact Chuck at [masked]. If you are going to attend a ride, but are running late, text Chuck at [masked]. We leave promptly at 6pm unless I know you are on your way.</p> <p>Please take time to fill out our \"After Action Survey\" after the ride. Your feedback will help us understand where we excel and where we may be falling behind. Your submission is anonymous (unless you include an email address for a response), so please don't hold back on the good and/or bad. Our goal is to make this a fun ride for everyone!

Next edition of our webinar series will include Gilad Bandel, VP Products at Arilou Cyber Security and he will be talking about the lessons learned that we need to understand and carry over into the automotive industry.</p> <p>PRESENTATION:</p> <p>\"Lessons Learned from IT &amp; ICS/SCADA Cyber\u2013Security Applied to Automotive\"</p> <p>The thesis presented here is that we can look back at three (not so) very different computing and network environments, study and analyze their histories and conclude what is expected to come in a new field. Specifically, we shall review the analogies between the IT (Information Technologies) networks, OT (Operational Technologies) \u2013 ICS (Industrial Control System)/SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) and the automotive cyber\u2013security protection solutions trying to anticipate the future of the automotive cyber\u2013security market based on similarities from the IT and ICS/SCADA behavior.</p> <p>The claim is that history will repeat itself and we can safely investigate the distant past of the IT world, the more recent ICS/SCADA fields, review the status of the automotive cyber-security and predict the future of things to come in this discipline. Furthermore, the trends foreseen here will be probably valid for additional emerging fields such as other transportation fields (railways, maritime and aviation), IoT (Internet of Things), IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things), Smart cities, Intelligent Transportation Systems, etc.</p> <p>Thanks,<br/>The ASRG-TLV Admin Team</p> <p>ABOUT THE PRESENTER:</p> <p>Gilad Bandel</p> <p>Vice President of Products at Arilou Cyber Security</p> <p>Gilad drives Arilou\u2019s automotive cyber-security product development. His focus is on delivering unique, innovative and novel functionality - delivering to market state-of-the-art solutions for in-vehicle cyber-security protection.</p> <p>Gilad is an accomplished executive with over 30 years of experience in the cyber-security and networking industries. Having covered markets in Europe, America and the APAC region, Gilad is a renowned expert in conceptualizing and developing go-to-market strategies. He specializes in business development for cyber-security devices and IoT solutions, in critical infrastructure and homeland security markets.</p> <p>Prior to joining Arilou, Gilad served as VP of Product at Radiflow and as Director of Product Management at CyberSeal (a Magal Security company). His goal was to provide cyber-security solutions for critical infrastructure. Earlier positions held include VP of R&amp;D, and CTO at leading networking, telecommunication and homeland security companies.</p>",

Originally a day of mass mobilization, we are leaning into healing and togetherness to provide comfort and inspiration during this time of unknown. As with all three days, we are using this platform to lift up the stories and voices of frontline, Indigenous, and POC leaders.</p> <p>On the second day, Thursday, April 23, we will target financial institutions across the country, calling for a global reset. We want to reprogram the economy so that it works for people and planet, not polluters and politicians. As we work to rebuild from the damage COVID-19 has done, we will be offering actions and explanations in how this can be done in a sustainable and equitable way.</p> <p>On the third day, Friday, April 24, we will focus on the urgency of political change through a nationwide youth voter registration day. We\u2019ll be using this day as an opportunity to train youth organizers on using digital, relational voter registration tools, and calling on elected officials to support the youth climate strike demands.</p>",

Just received an alert on my phone that we are all to stay home.</p> <p>This is such a difficult time for all of us with so much uncertainty.</p> <p>In an unprecedented way, parks and conservation areas are being closed off to the public. This is alarming and deeply concerns me, right now.</p> <p>My lifelong appreciation of our country\u2019s natural areas, and the many amazing and restorative experiences I\u2019ve enjoyed, inspire me to explore the beneficial opportunities that could arise and aid us in overcoming this catastrophe.</p> <p>I believe we need to consider how we can transform our natural areas, not close them, to help us through this pandemic and even guide us to a more environmentally responsible and sustainable future.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking to host the first Zoom meeting this coming week, so we can start exploring different ideas that could help stimulate inspired change.</p> <p>I\u2019d also appreciate your feedback and insights in the form of comments and messages.</p> <p>Please feel free to share this message, and an invitation to join Nature Guelph, with your family and friends.</p> <p>Regards...

This Enterprise Integrated Full Spectrum Investment concept will both help us through the economic crisis looming because of the pandemic, but will also help us build a more just, resilient, and equitable economy post-pandemic.</p> <p>Description</p> <p>Keeping small businesses and nonprofits alive during the pandemic may be the difference between a global recession versus depression. Because the CARES Act is too slow and does not adequately provide a safety net to keep many U.S. small businesses and nonprofits open during the pandemic, Impact Finance Center has been prototyping the Main Street Bucket Brigade and Enterprise Full Spectrum Capital Investment.</p> <p>Main Street Bucket Brigade is self-help infrastructure. We are dedicated to keeping Main Street social ventures - projects, nonprofits, small businesses, startups, cooperatives, and funds alive during the pandemic. If you are a Main Street social venture, you are invited to pre-sell your goods or services, request donations, or request Main Street loans.</p> <p>We are also inviting community members who want to spearhead a Bucket Brigade in their geography and/or interest area to join us and learn more about how they can help their local businesses get on this platform.</p> <p>If you would like to see previous webinar series recordings click here: <a href=\"https://impactfinctr.co/pathwrightwebinars\" class=\"linkified\">https://impactfinctr.co/pathwrightwebinars</a></p> <p>For any questions or comments email us at [masked]</p> <p>Sign up for our mailing list: <a href=\"https://impactfinctr.co/mailinglistWeekly\" class=\"linkified\">https://impactfinctr.co/mailinglistWeekly</a> webinar and Q&amp;A with Dr. Gripne on financial innovation &amp; impact investing in various sectors.

Please know there will be ample time after their presentation on each topic to take your questions. All questions will be via the chat bar (\u201cChat\u201d icon at the bottom of the screen.) At the start of our Meetup/Zoom meeting, I will remind you to please write down your questions as you are listening to the panelists, rather than add them to the chat box at that moment. Then, when the panelists tell me they are ready for questions, I will invite you to add your questions to the chat box (somewhat slowly, please!) as I will be moderating your questions and delivering them to the panelists. While we hope to get to every question, please understand that if your question is highly specific to your nonprofit, we might not be able to address it during this forum.</p> <p>There is a $11.71 fee payable to register which includes service and processing fees. For those of you who paid previously for this Meetup, I will send you the link directly</p>",

The pandemic has been described as climate change at warp speed. But the response to this \"greatest challenge\" has been quite different. Since this is such a ripe opportunity for learning, we (several eco-health colleagues and the SFU Planetary Health research group) are organizing a couple webinars with perhaps more if there's demand. We will begin by exploring the origins of the outbreak with lessons from the animal-human interface. We will then learn from previous economic collapses and what these lessons teach us about the coming weeks and months as we emerge from the current wave of disease and economic devastation to become a healthier planet than we were before the current pandemic. We will explore the relationships and resources needed for a recovery that makes us stronger and better able to face the challenges to planetary health that are even more critical than the COVID-19 pandemic, but that appear less imminent to society. Our primary goal is to articulate a shared vision of this future where society bounces back but bounces back to a better place than our pre-pandemic world.</p> <p>Session 2 Apr. 22 (MeetHere.org) 12:30-2pm Pacific Daylight Time (PDT)<br/>- Kris Ebi, PhD.

The health and economic impacts caused by both the COVID crisis and the climate crisis demand bold solutions that center the needs of working people and marginalized communities.</p> <p>Our movement seeks those solutions using our People Power, and we\u2019re ready to wield that power even though we can\u2019t take to the streets...the show must go on(line)! Please join us to Rally Online for a Green New Deal on Wednesday April 22nd, from 4:00 - 5:30pm. We\u2019ll hear from inspiring speakers about the connections between COVID-19 and climate, what a Green New Deal could look like in our community, and why we need it. We'll also hear personal stories and take crucial political actions together from our homes.</p> <p>We\u2019re asking you to bring 3 friends with you to the rally. (That means you should probably ask 6 people!) Or more!<br/>Share the RSVP link below, or invite them to our event on Facebook. Please share the attached flyer. Send it to friends, print it out and put it up in your windows, or ask your grocery store if you can post it publicly. Although we have to keep our physical distance, this moment demands social solidarity.

Socks or barefeet would also do.</p> <p>What Kind of Heels Should I Wear to a Heels Class?<br/>* Safety First *<br/>When choosing your hills, remember:<br/>1. The higher the heel, the harder it is to dance.<br/>2. An ideal shoe for a heels class has a stiletto heel. If you\u2019re new, try wearing a shoe with a thicker heel.<br/>3. Ankle support is everything! Your ankle and foot must be secure in your shoe. Pick a shoe that comes all the way up to your ankle and that is tight around it.</p> <p>Follow the link for more heels info: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@laurabduma/what-kind-of-heels-should-i-wear-to-a-heels-class-478e589377a3\" class=\"linkified\">https://medium.com/@laurabduma/what-kind-of-heels-should-i-wear-to-a-heels-class-478e589377a3</a></p>",

            "description_html": "<p>Details<br/>Dear Members: On April 22nd, Silicon Valley Law Group Shareholder Stephen Wu will host a Meetup webinar on \"Limited Legal Personhood for AI\" The guest speaker for the webinar will be John Frank Weaver. This Meetup is offered as a member benefit to Section members, although does not include CLE credits.<br/>Our topic:<br/>Nearly every law in the United States is built on an underlying assumption: only human beings make decisions. As autonomous technology, machine learning applications, and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI) become increasingly ubiquitous around us, that assumption becomes less true, causing tension between how we use technology and how legal models function. In this presentation, John Frank Weaver will discuss how granting limited legal personhood (similar to cities and corporations) to certain forms of AI addresses that tension and ensures that laws function properly. After explaining limited legal personhood and some of the problems inherent in regulating AI and any emerging technology, John will present situations where countries are already granting some forms of limited legal personhood to AI. From there, John will discuss key areas where the law does not properly address the functionalities of AI applications and how limited legal personhood can help.<br/>Our speaker:<br/>John Frank Weaver is an attorney with a practice focused on data privacy and emerging technology, including artificial intelligence. In a field where the law is frequently being made up on the fly, he counsels clients on existing and emerging regulations and best practices, as well as using data and technology governance to support their brand and customer engagement. He is the author of the book Robots Are People Too, which explores legal issues implicated by autonomous technology and AI, and a contributing writer at Slate magazine, where his articles have focused on similar issues. He is also a member of the board of editors and a columnist for The Journal of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence &amp; Law. John is a sought after speaker on topics related to law and emerging technologies, and has been interviewed by The Atlantic, Consumer Reports, and the Wall Street Journal, among other media outlets.<br/>Here is a link to the Zoom videoconference link to participate.<br/>Join Zoom Meeting<br/><a href=\"https://zoom.us/j/988174151?pwd=amd0blV6aExsa1hqSUVzaE9mQWRRdz09\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/j/988174151?pwd=amd0blV6aExsa1hqSUVzaE9mQWRRdz09</a><br/>Once you click on the link, it will give you the option of viewing and listening to the program using your computer or dialing in to a phone number that the system will provide.<br/>Slides: Zoom allows you to see the slides during the program, but we will also distribute a pdf of the slides by download afterwards.<br/>We hope you can attend this talk and thank you for your interest.<br/>Steve Wu</p> <p>\u2022 Important to know: In light of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), this program will be a webinar-only event.</p>",

From catwalks to advertising campaigns, brands in days past have typically veered towards models of a typical build, age, and ethnicity \u2013 but we all know the world is a much richer tapestry. However, in recent years, the industry has been doing more to champion diversity, and we are seeing a much more inclusive approach to representation.</p> <p>In the previous AFA Fashion Talk we discussed about how Covid-19 will influence Fashion Digital Marketing. During this new online Meetup, we will explore Diversity and Inclusion in Fashion through four talks. As usual, we will start with the presentations by senior students of their academic researches and we will end with the talk by an expert.</p> <p>1. \"The influences of Fashion Trends on Gender Roles\", by Sabrina Marinus, 3rd-year student of the BA (Hons) Fashion with Textiles Design.</p> <p>2. \"Cultural Appropriation and Fashion\", by Gabriella Frempong, 3rd-year student of the BA (Hons) Fashion with Textiles Design.</p> <p>3. \"Gender Neutral Fashion, Is There a Future?\", by Quirine Galavazi, 3rd-year student of the BA (Hons) Fashion with Textiles Design.</p> <p>4. \"Perspectives on Diversity and Inclusion in the Fashion Industry\", by Giancarlo Pazzanese, lecturer of the Amsterdam Fashion Academy.</p> <p>At the end of the four talks, you will have the opportunity to ask questions to the panelists.</p> <p>Please, click on the link to register: <a href=\"https://luiss.webex.com/luiss/onstage/g.php?MTID=e017282e03b498828e710cbb1cc96c5ba\" class=\"linkified\">https://luiss.webex.com/luiss/onstage/g.php?MTID=e017282e03b498828e710cbb1cc96c5ba</a></p> <p>This Online Meetup has no costs.

Fashion Revolution aims to bring awareness and action to important social and environmental issues around fashion. April 20 - 26 is supposed to be the official FR week, but because of the global virus we are facing, many events have been put on line.</p> <p>One of those events is a LIVE YouTube discussion on Friday, April 24 11:00-13:00 BST (I believe that is noon Z\u00fcrich time) The title of the talk is:</p> <p>Mass Consumption: The End of an Era?</p> <p>\u201cfocus on the topic of mass production and consumption and its impact on our planet and the people who make our clothes.\u201d</p> <p>You can find access to the event through the Fashion Revolution YouTube channel. I think it will be a really interesting talk! You can find other events and lots of good information on their Instagram account and through their main site:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.fashionrevolution.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.fashionrevolution.org</a></p> <p>Again, I\u2019m not hosting this. I\u2019m merely using this planner to share all the info. Be sure to check out Fashion Revolution on Instagram, YouTube and their website for lots of good info!</p> <p>I hope you are all well :)</p> <p>We will chat again soon,<br/>Elianne</p>",

The more of our stash fabrics we get through, the more experience we gain and the more satisfying the sewing process can become.</p> <p>I must admit that I have not yet started the navy/cream velvet top I want to make - and that's because I am not sure that I picked a suitable pattern. I did start a sleeveless blouse with a different stash fabric (nothing to do with the velvet project just because I got the sudden urge). And I started a toile out of a newly bought and very cheap black jersey so I can evaluate the Lekala pattern I was going to use for my precious velvet. I also used a grey jersey fabric from my stash for a simple raglan sleeved top and now wonder if that mightn't be the best pattern for the velvet?</p> <p>Every practical bit that I get to do teaches me what works and what doesn't. Unfortunately I often stop at the stage of \"oh crikey I've run into a problem\" and never picked the project back up. That gets very frustrating. It makes such a nice change this time: I threw myself into sewing with any fabric and any pattern that mysteriously made its way onto my sewing table. I will tackle the velvet, I promise!</p> <p>What are you making, what kinds of stash fabric have you used recently and which do you think you might use next? Pictures please!</p>",

However, we need to settle down and not to panic. So many people are struggling to cope up the psychological strain and meditation would come in handy.</p> <p>We used to host Meditation Happy Hours, where we meditate together and go our for drinks. Unfortunately, we could not do so, in the present situation. However, we migrated it to an online event. Our Coach gives us a brief run down of the event and leads the session. After the session we will get to socialize for few minutes.</p> <p>When you purchase a ticket, you will be emailed the Event ID and Password.</p> <p>Payment Instructions :</p> <p>1. You should login from a PC to see the 'Pay Now' button, after RSVPing. Then hit the button.</p> <p>2. Verify correct dollar amount for number of people you're paying for.</p> <p>3. If you don't have a Paypal account, click \"Pay with a Debit or Credit Card\".</p> <p>4. If you have a Paypal account, simply log in, and pay as you normally would via Paypal.</p> <p>Refund &amp; Ticket Resell</p> <p>All sales are final. We only refund the full amount, if the event is canceled. If it is rescheduled, we will send an email to those who RSVPed 'YES' advising that. A full refund will be given to those that let us know within 2 calendar days of the update email, if you are unable to make it on the new date. No refunds will be given after that time.</p> <p>However, you can sell your ticket to someone else if you are unable to attend. Please, feel free to post in the comment box for the event, that you have a ticket for sale. Work out payment between yourselves, and have the seller only send the organizer a message letting us know the full name of the person taking your spot. You must let us know two hours before the RSVP close time, on the day of the event.</p>",

Seattle &amp; King County is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect the public's health.</p> <p>We understand these actions will have a tremendous impact on all members of our community. These efforts are meant to slow the spread of novel coronavirus and reduce the number of people infected.<br/>*****</p> <p>Join the us for one of our rotating four-mile running routes! All paces are welcome! Every week, no matter what, we always hang out and socialize afterward at nearby Fremont Brewing, which has tasty craft beer and cider on tap, as well as some non-alcoholic options.</p> <p>Check out our \"subway map\" that shows all of the routes, and the 2020 route schedule (<a href=\"https://goo.gl/DjtGey\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/DjtGey</a> ) to see where we're running this week. Hosts Patrick, Yao, Chris, and Denise provide mini route maps and always make sure that everyone arrives safely back to port. If you're looking for something a little shorter, just ask us for some shortcut suggestions.</p> <p>Despite what you see in the RSVP list, we typically have 15-30 runners each week, with many regulars who know the routes. Newbies are always welcome, as are any out-of-town runners looking for a fun group of runners!</p> <p>We start meeting up at 5:15pm inside the Brooks Trailhead store at 3400 Stone Way in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. At 5:35pm, we have introductions, describe the route, take a group photo, and head out the door. Most of our routes have a photo stop, usually about halfway, where we regroup. We return to the store, and then head over to Fremont Brewing.</p> <p>In the winter months (November-February), please bring headlamps and reflective gear. In the summer months (June-August), bring a yoga mat if you like, as some of us join a free/donation yoga class at Gas Works Park after the run at 6:30pm. Occasionally, this run is paired with special activities at the store, such as meet-and-greets with Brooks-sponsored athletes or presentations by the Rock'n'Roll Marathon. And twice a year, we organize our own \"adventure runs\" throughout the neighborhood!</p> <p>At the store, lockers with locks are provided for your stuff, and water and towels are available when we get back.</p> <p>Dogs are welcome! We frequently have dogs with us during the run and at the dog-friendly brewery.</p> <p>If you're thinking about bringing a jogging stroller, please ask us about this week's route. Some of our rotating routes are already stroller-friendly, some would need just a few minor adjustments, and some would be miserable-to-impossible. Hosts Patrick and Chris oftentimes run with strollers!</p> <p>===================</p> <p>If you're new to the Seattle Green Lake Running Group (SGLRG), the Wednesday Night Run is just one of our many regular weekly runs.</p> <p>Monday Morning Track (5:30am)<br/>Monday Evening Track (6:30pm)<br/>Tuesday Evening Run (6:30pm)<br/>Wake Up Wednesday (5:30am)<br/>Wednesday Night Run (5:30pm)<br/>Thursday Evening Casual Run (6:30pm)<br/>Friday Lake Union Run (6:00am)<br/>Saturday Morning Rise &amp; Shine (7:00am)<br/>Saturday Mid-Morning Run (9:00am)</p> <p>Sunday runs depend on the week and rotate between trails, stairs, and easy.</p> <p>See the entire SGLRG calendar here:<br/><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Greenlake-Running-Group/events/calendar/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Greenlake-Running-Group/events/calendar/</a></p>",

But this is something so much more exciting.</p> <p>Active from April 16 to April 25 this year, the Lyrid meteor shower is a long-running and occasionally incredible celestial event. Due to peak in the early hours of Wednesday, April 22, the Lyrids usually produce about 10 to 20 shooting stars per hour, though the shower has been known to sometimes produce hundreds for lucky onlookers. Each shooting star whizzes overhead at 30 miles per second, according to NASA. From your backyard, it should be possible to see some shooting stars produced by the Lyrid meteor shower just by stargazing outside if it\u2019s a clear sky. The best way to see them is to simply go outside in the pre-dawn hours on April 22 \u2014 when the night-side of Earth is traveling head-first into the dust trails that cause the Lyrids. The radiant for this meteor shower is close to the constellation of Lyra, whose bright star Vega is easy to spot rising in the east, but shooting stars can occur anywhere in the sky. The best advice is to look generally east-southeast. Since the skies are dark, the nights before and after April 22 should be almost as good for catching a falling star or two.</p>",

What better way to do this than by learning how to make great coffee at home from a pro who can also share some great life lessons?

And please feel free to invite your friends!</p> <p>A bit about Donny:<br/>Donny Raus has been active in the coffee community for 14+ years. Having worked in various capacities, from barista to an educator and roaster, one thing has always rung true, coffee and people have always been his passions.<br/>In college he worked for Starbucks and was selected to become one of the company\u2019s first certified coffee specialist with the title\u00a0\"Coffee Master\". Later taking a job in corporate accounting and brought his coffee with him, literally. Armed with an espresso maker, drip coffee pot, and a half a dozen single origin coffees, his office became the meeting spot for company executives to get a great cup of coffee.\u00a0<br/>While still at Starbucks he started the \u201cFree Pour Mailing List\u201d, the company's first comprehensive mailing list to include\u00a0new product highlights, coffee tastings\u00a0and pairing notes, equipment reviews, and subscriber Q&amp;A. He also spent his time traveling the region presenting \u201cCoffee Talk\u201d, an educational series on coffee and was commended by the company\u2019s President.<br/>In 2005 he left Starbucks, as well as, the corporate world and in 2007 he founded the Connecticut Coffee Society, educating\u00a0all who wanted to learn about the magic beverage through cupping. That same year he was elected President of the Northeast Regional Roasters Group, in charge of organizing the group's annual roasters retreat, where he served a term of 3-years.<br/>Deciding there wasn\u2019t anything he\u2019d rather do, in October 2007 took a leap of faith and started Raus Coffee Company, where he aims to make a difference by doing what he loves, coffee.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rauscoffee.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rauscoffee.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/donnyraus\" class=\"linkified\">https://m.facebook.com/donnyraus</a></p>",

The reading will last between 15-20 minutes.</p> <p>When reaching for a new level of understanding of our lives, when we have a very specific question we would like an answer to, or when we would just like to know if we are \"on-track\"; that's when we find support through any number of psychic readings. Martha ALWAYS connects with love and light. She believes in the strength and power of God, Source Energy (or whichever term feels correct to you). Her aim is to help you gain understanding, identify opportunities, to hone in on possible events or circumstances that may be of help you. Martha connects with your Spirit Guides and Guardian Angels to bring you the most helpful and uplifting information.<br/>------------------------------------</p> <p>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING:</p> <p>\"Her reading literally changed my life...\" - Angela</p> <p>\"My reading with Martha was wonderful. She offered real insight into an uncomfortable situation I was in, which proved to be very helpful. Plus, the cards indicated there would be an upcoming celebration and not too long after my reading my brother announced he was getting married. So exciting.\" - Rayna K.</p> <p>\"The reading itself is a vibration shifter...\" - Barbara</p> <p>A MESSAGE FROM MARTHA:</p> <p>I am a psychic and a medium: the cards are a tool for my abilities to flow to you.</p> <p>How My Psychic Abilities Work for You:</p> <p>\u200bClairvoyance: I see images like snapshots and symbols or stories that unfold in my mind like a movie.</p> <p>Clairaudience: I hear clearly messages in the form of words, sentences or music.</p> <p>Clairsentience: I feel the feelings and energy of those near and far and make clear sense of what it is I am perceiving.</p> <p>Medium/Channel: Using all of the above mentioned abilities as well as allowing information to flow right through my mind from our Spirit Guides and Angels. I do my best to step aside and allow them to use my knowledge and senses to express their messages to you.</p> <p>.........................................</p> <p>REAL GOOGLE REVIEWS:</p> <p>I can confidently say that I will definitely be going back to her! Her kind and gentle soul along side her sunny disposition made me feel open and connected to her instantly. Her reading was extremely positive, and enlightening.</p> <p>- Danielle, Orange County, NY</p> <p>---------------</p> <p>Thank you so much for everything honestly. I can't express enough how grateful I am to have met you.</p> <p>- Joseph, Dutchess County</p> <p>---------------</p> <p>I cannot even begin to describe how amazing the reading was! Martha provided me with so much information, clarity, and helped to guide me in the right direction. She\u2019s very honest with her delivery and feedback. She\u2019s an excellent listener and it\u2019s clear she\u2019s genuinely interested and makes an effort to connect to her clients; I felt like I Knew her for years! I will definitely be back again! 5 STARS FOR MARTHA!</p> <p>- Alissa C., Queens, NY</p> <p>This event is on several days of the week so click the link next to the day you're interested in:<br/>SATURDAY: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/102094216550\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/102094216550</a><br/>SUNDAY: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/102103333820\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/102103333820</a><br/>WEDNESDAY: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/102104094094\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/102104094094</a></p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/5/4/4/highres_490050020.jpeg\" /></p>",

After determining the \"doorways to nowhere\" needed more powerful magic to be activated the group headed back to the room with the marble statues. The group split-up to explore different rooms to see what could be found or discovered. The monk went into the well lit room just a few steps from the statue room and found carved images &amp; a strange globe w/ pointer but didn't determine its purpose if any. Other members went into the large room with a grass floor, not odd for a underground temple, and found a nice fountain, fresh dirt to dig in and a few different statues. After the rogue defaced a statue,even after being warned, the guardians came to life. The seated statues opened their boxes and floating heads arose. The Paladins' amazingly avoided the devastating special attacks and the Oracle finished off the final threat posed by the guardians. While resting in the wizards floating dimensional motel the monk noticed a familiar figure appear. Nirena strode below unaware of the groups presence. She checked the aftermath of the encounter then returned to the vampire looking statue. The monk witnessed the activation process to acquire the planar tuning fork. Will the adventurers follow?

You'll need a free account and client (there are downloadable clients as well as browser-based) and we'll post the link to the meeting before the game starts.</p> <p>Barrowmaze is a modern old school dungeon filled with danger and treasure. There's an emerging story to discover, but plenty of fun to be had if you'd just prefer to show up, grab a character sheet, kick in the door and try to make it out with fortune and glory.</p> <p>The game rules:<br/>We are using a freely available rule set that will be immediately familiar to anyone who has played Basic / Expert D&amp;D, or AD&amp;D, and is easily approachable without nothing but a desire to learn for those new to fantasy RPGs. See the links to the Basic Fantasy RPG rules in the message board if you'd like to read up beforehand.</p> <p>What to bring:<br/>You need bring nothing but a set of dice and a desire to have a fun night, whether you play once or every time.</p> <p>Misc:<br/>We continue to have a great time meeting new folks and seeing familiar faces interested in discovering or already into old school gaming!</p>",

These lesser enemies were no match for the party and were dispatched with relative ease.</p> <p>Heading back to the mind flayer lair, the party encountered a pair of flumphs that took a liking to Groot and agreed to help the group if they could mark the paladin with their scent. Trenifee convinced Groot to allow the flumphs to mark his shield, which left a foul stench emanating from him.</p> <p>The flumphs used their tentacles to manipulate the Qualith (the braille-like writing) doors and the group moved through about the lair. They found a large number of crystalline cylinders containing various humanoids in some type of suspended animation. The group couldn't quite figure out how to disable the cylinders and left the area in hopes of possibly finding a solution further in.</p> <p>The party encountered a pair of Ulitharid and more Ettins in a large, long hallway. Through Marinus' manipulation of a nearby underground river, and with party picking off the creatures from range, this group, too, was defeated.</p> <p>Further in the lair the group found a room containing a statue and an inactive arch gate, the gate depicting three stick-figures holding hands. Four party members linked up hands on the far side of the room and were promptly hit with a Prismatic Spray spell from the statue. Gia investigated the statue and surmised the covering it in Darkness would alleviate it's ability to 'see' the group. Trenifee provided the spell and three members linked hands next to the gate and it activated.</p> <p>The group stepped through into a room containing furniture made entirely of bone and skin, though free of enemies. Gia set up a magic mansion and the group took a much-needed rest.</p> <p>***CHECK GROUP MESSAGE FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS***</p>",

If you are not able to make it, we will post a recording of the event in the App for you. We will offer more future sessions and our aim is always to try alternate timezones so that it is mainly accessible to the USA and the next time in Europe.</p> <p>In this session Jason and Ingo will talk about topic related to Tantra. They will give you some of their ideas, some practices and some meditations that you can take away and try them out.</p> <p>This is an interactive session, so please come and attend and be up for taking part. The beauty of this session is that it is interactive. So please bring us your questions about anything related to your life or to Tantra. Maybe talk to us about any problems or issues that you\u2019d like to explore, or things you are not sure about, maybe ask the questions you never dare to ask. Maybe you want to share your experience and see if there are any insights that we can offer? Here is a place where all of your questions, things you are struggling with, ideas that you want, all of that is on offer in this call.</p> <p>Please be aware that if you choose to join this call it will be recorded and posted in to the App only so that other members can catch up afterwards. By attending the group call you agree to this being recorded and being shared within the app.</p> <p>The purpose of these sessions is to help stimulate conversation on different ideas in Tantra. The aim is to make it interactive and to make it about you. Jason and Ingo are not therapists and are not medically trained. Any questions, reflections or ideas are offered from our perspective as Tantra Teachers with the aim of helping you to gain a deeper understanding, or, to give you some ideas of how you might explore the different topics that you bring. The questions or ideas offered, you accept these of your own volition and if at any point you want us to stop, please do let us know. Our only role is to support your enquiry, support you deepening your understanding of what's going on and and to explore where Tantra may support you.</p> <p>Often by listening to others ideas, or things they are struggling with, you can help see how it relates to you and to the areas in your own life that you are working on.</p> <p>At the beginning of the call we will ask for those that would like sometime to ask questions or to explore anything related to the topic. We will offer those spaces on a 1st come 1st served basis and it might be that we do not have time to talk to talk to everyone, but we will do our best.</p> <p>This is a great way to meet Jason and Ingo and to experience our work and ideas to see if it resonates for you. It might be that you would then like to explore Tantra more deeply by attending one of their live in person events.</p> <p>Amsterdam, Netherlands - Wed, 22 Apr 2020 at 20:00 CEST</p> <p>London, United Kingdom - Wed, 22 Apr 2020 at 19:00 BST</p> <p>New York, USA - Wed, 22 Apr 2020 at 14:00 EDT</p> <p>Austin, USA - Wed, 22 Apr 2020 at 13:00 CDT</p> <p>San Francisco, USA - Wed, 22 Apr 2020 at 11:00 PDT</p> <p>Sydney, Australia - Thu, 23 Apr 2020 at 05:00 AEDT</p> <p>Anchorage, USA - Wed, 22 Apr 2020 at 10:00 AKDT</p> <p>To register for this event you must download the App using one of the links below, go to the Events section, find the event and read the joining instructions.</p> <p>Download it FREE from your google or apple store, search \"tantra 4 gay men\" and our app will come up, download, join and enter a world of tantric men.

This is because as humans, we are social animals and hardwired for touch.</p> <p>Since we cannot gather in person for group cuddle sessions, I'd like to offer a virtual self-touch session. I know many of us are single and may not get opportunities for touch. I will be taking us through a self-touching ritual that we can do on our own. In this workshop, we will experience and experiment with various types of touch.</p> <p>The session will be clothing-optional so you can have greater skin access. Just remember this about being SENSUAL, not sexual.</p> <p>You will want to set your space up to create a warm, welcoming environment (candles, dim lights, aromatherapy scents are good). You can choose to be seated comfortably, or to lie down. If you have it, have some massage oil or other oil handy. Also useful to have would be some of your favorite textures - faux furs, your favorite blanket, silks, merino wool...you decide.</p> <p>Please join in early to prevent disruptions during our session.</p> <p>Feel free to send me a message if you have any questions.</p> <p>The session will only be 40 minutes because I'm trying out the Zoom platform and 40 minutes is the limit it has on basic accounts. Depending on how popular the virtual program is, I will consider purchasing a premium plan. If you don't have Zoom already, please consider downloading it ahead of time. This will be a video-on session, so we can see everyone.

We're a community-based support and discussion group serving the metro NYC area... all volunteer run, open to bi+ identifying folx and our allies.</p> <p>We're all folx who've been there.

We are the B in LGBT.</p> <p>We are a multi-racial and many gendered and variously sex'd people. We are uniquely challenged and able in many different ways.

Until such time as Outlink's office reopens, we will be hosting our regular peer support groups through Zoom, an online platform that support audio, video, and text based communication.</p> <p>Between Men is a group for men who are gay, bi, trans, queer, questioning their sexuality, or who otherwise have sex with men. Non-binary folks who see themselves reflected in this space are absolutely welcome to attend. It is a safe space where we can talk openly and honestly.</p> <p>Together we can work towards making sense of our sexualities and genders and the ways they impact us. Together we can realize our individual strengths and sort through the negative views of ourselves we've been picking up since we first realized we were different. When Between Men meets, we will have the chance to share our experiences and our struggles. We will be heard and feel important. We will help each other liberate ourselves from our pain. Besides all the serious stuff. we will socialize and meet new people, having fun among supportive and safe company.</p> <p>Please note that this meeting is moderated by Outlink staff/volunteers who reserve the right to remove anyone from the group who is in violation of our Safer Space Ground Rules (available on our website).<br/>This meetup is intended as a space for peer support and casual connection. This is not a structured therapy group nor is it a dating space. If you are looking for further support, Outlink staff are available to meet with you one-on-one or in small groups by phone, text based messaging, or video call upon request.

There will be a demo of the Digital Storytelling Project, a discussion of ongoing projects and then a breakout into groups for project specific work. Everyone is welcome -- all skills, interests, talents, etc.! Come and join.</p> <p>What's a CivicTechWR Hacknight?<br/>We meet every 2 weeks, usually alternating between speaker sessions and working sessions. At our speaker sessions, we host a leader from the community to speak to the group. This could be someone from a local non-profit, from government, from industry, or any citizen - what matters is that they have something to discuss with our group, something to teach us, or something to inspire us. During both our speaker sessions and our hacknights, we provide space and time for people to work together on civic tech projects. This event is one of those project-only hacknights.</p> <p>What to bring:<br/>Your ideas, your skills, a collaborative spirit.</p> <p>What is CivicTechWR?<br/>CivicTechWR brings together people from different sectors and industries to actively solve issues facing our local community. We welcome people with all types and levels of skills. Even though \"tech\" is in the name, everyone is welcome and everyone has a skill or experience that is valuable. We're here to empower people to work together, exchange ideas and tools to improve the lives of the residents in and around Waterloo Region through civic technology.</p>",

How would you define mental health? What falls under the mental health umbrella?</p> <p>2. What impacts do you think racism has had on the mental health of the people of the United States of America?</p> <p>3. Do you believe there are differences in the quality of mental health care that minority patients receive as has been well documented in the physical health context?</p> <p>4. Do black people and white people have different mental health needs? If so, why do you believe those differences exist?</p> <p>5. Do you have a story about yourself, someone else, or something that was depicted in media that reminds you of the widely agreed upon taboo of addressing mental health issues in minority communities?</p> <p>The group discussion starts at 7pm. The Jitsi Meet App link will be made available to everyone that RSVPs for this event. We hope to see you there!</p>",

Booking is essential.<br/>To register, please write to [masked] with your name and we will send you the link to join the online call.</p> <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p> <p>Since the corona pandemic, issues of affordable housing and speculation are as pressing as never before. How are activists in the city dealing with the current crisis? How are they restructuring their work and keep fighting for affordable housing for all, and what is happening to stop evictions in times where people are urged to stay at home?<br/>Warming up to our online conference EVICTED BY GREED: Global Finance, Housing &amp; Resistance (29-31 May 2020 - <a href=\"https://www.disruptionlab.org/evicted-by-greed\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.disruptionlab.org/evicted-by-greed</a>), we invite you to join a collective discussion with two collectives working on housing issues.</p> <p>The Syndikat collective, who has been running their Neuko\u0308lln bar since 1985, will share the story of how they uncovered the ownership structures of their building, and how this brought them to a letterbox with 75 other names in Luxembourg. Also, they will give an update on the situation around their eviction that was previously planned for 17 April 2020. The Bu\u0308ndnis Zwangsra\u0308umung verhindern will speak about how they work on stopping forced evictions in Berlin, especially in these difficult times.</p> <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p> <p>Programme \u2013 Starting from 19:00<br/>\u2022 Introduction of participants<br/>\u2022 Talk by Syndikat collective on their research<br/>\u2022 Talk by Bu\u0308ndnis Zwangsra\u0308umung verhindern on their work<br/>\u2022 Collective discussion</p> <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p> <p>Syndikat is a collectively self-organised neighbourhood bar that has existed in Neuko\u0308lln's Schillerkiez since 1985. In the summer of 2018, Syndikat received an eviction notice, and supporters began the search for the actual figure behind the Luxembourg letterbox company to which the building at Weisestra\u00dfe 56 belongs \u2013 at least on paper. They encountered not only a vast network of dozens of shell companies, but also the beneficiary of the entire construct: Pears Global, until that point a still-undiscovered but major player on the Berlin real estate market. The eviction of the Syndikat bar was originally planned for 17 April 2020, but has for now been cancelled for that day.<br/><a href=\"https://syndikatbleibt.noblogs.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://syndikatbleibt.noblogs.org/</a></p> <p>Bu\u0308ndnis Zwangsr\u00e4umung Verhindern [Stop Evictions]<br/>The Stop Evictions alliance has been struggling since 2012 through many forms of civil disobedience for the right of housing and forced evictions. In recent years displacement of people on lower incomes from the city centre has become a sad reality. The process is similar to many other cities, the speculative strategies of private owners, real estate and public housing companies who are trying to extract the maximum profit from their houses. Our group strives for a society based on mutual aid and solidarity, and organizes diverse and public protest against this together with those who have been affected.<br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zwangsraeumungverhindern/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/zwangsraeumungverhindern/</a></p> <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p> <p>The Disruption Network Lab Activation program is kindly supported by the Guerrilla Foundation.

            "description_html": "<p>This Meetup is about the sharing of ideas in a public and open forum where participants can come to learn and teach. In order for people to feel comfortable expressing their, what may be controversial, views we aim to create an environment that is not absent passion, but is cordial to people who may even have extreme views. It is incumbent upon all participants to contribute in fostering that environment.</p> <p>The Meetup is divided into three consecutive sessions:<br/>I. One Minutes - An icebreaker. We go around the room and ask each person to state their first name and then talk about anything that is on their mind for approximately one minute.</p> <p>II. Topical discussion - The heart of the Meetup where we put a topic on the table and ask those who choose to share any opinion or idea around the topic. We informally toss around a stuffed animal which serves as a \"talking stick.\" When you have it in your possession you have the floor. We loosely spend about 15 minutes on each topic depending on the number of people in attendance. This is not the time for debate, but there is room for anyone to ask some clarifying questions of the speaker in order to better understand their point of view. The goal is not to change minds in this section, but to give those minds food for thought.</p> <p>III. Meetup after the Meetup - This is the end of the \"formal\" Meetup and where the healthy debate can take place. With smaller groups we passionately argue things that we may have talked about in topical discussion to everything else on the planet. Some say this is the best part and some people loathe the passion and the volume. Some leave before or during this part and others show up just for it. It can last for hours.</p> <p>If there are rules to this Meetup, these are them:</p> <p>BE RESPECTFUL TO EVERYONE regardless of their views on any subject.<br/>Bring your voice and passion, but leave your anger and condescension at home.<br/>If you get angry at differing opinions, please realize that this is not the place for you and kindly do not attend.<br/>Eat, drink and be merry and tip well if you can.<br/>We don't have to leave as friends, but we can't leave as enemies.</p> <p>As usual there is a lot to talk about. Here are some of the topics we could explore:</p> <p>Do you take your relationship(s) for granted? Can that be a good thing? Should your children take your love for granted?</p> <p>Does President Trump really want a second term? What makes you think so?</p> <p>Was President Trump taking to foreign officials about a political rival an impeachable offense?</p> <p>The Black New Channel is launching in November of this year. What do you think about that? The Chairman is former GOP Congressman J.C. Watts.</p> <p>What happens if all the fears that have been foretold come true with respect to climate change? Will our children experience a drastically different world than the one we live in now? If so, will that world be necessarily better or worse? Or just different?</p> <p>Warren has passed up Biden in a national poll. Is this a good thing?</p> <p>Is talking about religion becoming unfashionable?</p> <p>I look forward to talking to you all.</p> <p>Glenn</p>",

Be it psychological, or physical, Mother Earth is there each day with so many benefits just waiting to be seeped into our souls.</p> <p>\"Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt\" ~John Muir</p> <p>Sad but true, in this modern society of screens and rubber healed shoes, we have lost connection with good ole Mother Nature. That loss of connection seems also to have lowered our respect for her well-being as we see trash on the ground wherever we go.</p> <p>\"We have forgotten to be good guests, how to walk lightly on the earth as its other creatures do\" ~Barbara Ward</p> <p>So...What better time to reconnect than on Earth Day??? What better time is there to take a walk in nature? And what better way to show appreciation for our Mother Earth, than by picking up trash as we walk among the trees, grass, water and flowers of Spring?</p> <p>What to do:<br/>Step 1: Say, YES! to the meetup! to motivate the masses! (This should be my biggest meetup to date! As, wherever you are, you can participate!)<br/>Step 2: Since we are still in health and safety mode for Covid-19, I would love for you to join me in spirit for Earth Day 2020 by grabbing a trash bag and heading out to your favorite trail or park. Or, maybe try a new trail you have never been to! As you walk and take in the beauty of nature around you, show Mother Nature some love, by picking up trash along the way. In the end, you will feel better not just in body, but in spirit and soul.<br/>Step 3: Post a picture to this meetup of your experience, so we can all at least join each other virtually in the spirit and good cause of the day.</p> <p>Stay Happy and Healthy my Friends!<br/>Marianda</p>",

Coming from a lifelong background in dance and a family of artists and musicians, I have always found movement and creative expression to be a vital part of emotional work and healing. In my studies and work in the mental health field for over 10 years, I have witnessed first hand how yoga and other practices that incorporate the whole being provide much more than just temporary symptom relief. These practices foster a deep a true understanding of your process to stimulate healing, helping you to move forward with strength, resiliency, and trust in yourselves to make healthy life choices, becoming more skillfully adept in your thoughts and reactions to life's challenges.</p> <p>In classes and private sessions with me I guide you in mindfulness practices, meditations, and movement flows that tap into multiple facets of what it means to be human. My group classes are mixed level and meet each student where they are at while still challenging them to reach new heights of self-realization, acceptance, strength and flexibility, both on and off of the mat. I will push you to challenge yourself while also guiding you to listen to your body and intuition. I teach from a place of authenticity, passion and playfulness.</p> <p>\"Strength to show up, to be your authentic self, and be heard. Let yoga be a guide to get you there.\"</p> <p>See you on the mat \u2665<br/>Om Shanti Shanti Shanti<br/>Peace to all.</p> <p>For questions please contact Rachel Jennine at:<br/>racheljenninewellnessandyoga.com<br/>or<br/>[masked]</p> <p>Credentials:</p> <p>Psy.D.

Cathy Grippi[masked]</p> <p>BIO: After years of seeking relief from physical and emotional pain, Cathy Grippi discovered LaughterYyoga in early 2016. The effects were so profound, Cathy became a Laughter Yoga Leader in the spring of 2016, and became a Certified Laughter Yoga Leader Teacher in the summer of 2019, with Laughter Yoga International University. In the fall of 2019, Cathy became a Certified Laughter Leader with the World Laughter Tour. Cathy is am member of AATH, the Association of Applied and Theraputic Humor, where she is participating in their Humor Academy, which provides insight and more on how we can use humor in our daily lives - in productive ways.</p> <p>In the winter of 2017, Cathy began Laughter in the Park, which continues each Saturday morning on Venice Island. Cathy has brought Laughter Yoga to assisted living and memory care facilities, mentally challenged young adult programs as well as summer camps for the general population. The opportunity to bring this unique exercise modality to Blue Lotus Meditation and Holistic Center provides the public with opportunities to experience this practice in a different way that is done outside in a park setting.</p>",

We will do the same throughout April. This message is an update, with information about what we are offering while we are not meeting in person.</p> <p>We know that a primary measure to diminishing the spread of Covid-19 virus is social distancing, limiting our contact with others and especially groups. It\u2019s important to be aware that physical separation does not mean spiritual separation. This circumstance may even provide greater opportunity for awareness of deeper spiritual connectivity.</p> <p>It can be difficult to let go of a beloved practice such as dancing and praying together because of all that we desire to share this way. We may feel sad to consider going without this sharing in the face of the uncertainty we find ourselves dealing with. The support we find through community is vital to our sense of well-being.</p> <p>So, we\u2019re creating ways to celebrate our deeper connection in the Infinite even as we navigate these challenging times, a way to connect and to do practice, holding the intention to connect in community with heart and presence and to cultivate a healing influence for ourselves and others.</p> <p>Find details below!</p> <p>May All Beings Be Well<br/>May All Beings Be Happy<br/>May All Beings Be Safe,<br/>Peace Peace Peace.</p> <p>Rahmana and Shivadam, Phoenix Area Dances of Universal Peace</p> <p>______________</p> <p>TWO ZOOM meetings (online, free)</p> <p>Please join us Wednesdays for the morning and/or the evening group.

It follows the class action lawsuit against Johnson&amp;Johnson and the plaintiffs, personal stories of women fighting for justice in a race against time with this deadly disease.</p> <p>Woven throughout the film is a human experiment. We document, as Boston University medical student, Mymy Nguyen, measures her chemical body burden from over 27 products. Scientists monitor her shocking results.</p> <p>In the end, the film meets the companies and people who offer solutions and optimism for safer, toxicant free cosmetics.</p> <p>Directed by Phyllis Ellis. 90 minutes</p>",

            "description_html": "<p>UPDATE 4/19/20: To attend this virtual meeting, you will need to visit the link where it says \"Online Event\" and pre-register. After registering, you will receive an email confirmation. This registration website says Windermere--don't worry, it's the correct site! The registration asks for your name and email. We are doing this registration process so that we don't get people coming into the meeting who aren't invited (like Zoombombers). If you do not already have the (free) zoom app on your computer or phone or other video-enabled device, you should also download that before the meeting on Wednesday. Let me or Jamie DeHaven know if you have any issues getting into the meeting!</p> <p>We decided to just postpone our discussion for the books we were going to discuss in March (2020 Adaptations) until this meeting in April, and also go ahead and finish our readalong of the Throne of Glass series, by discussing Tower of Dawn AND Kingdom of Ash. So we'll have four books to discuss at this meeting in April. As always, only read the ones you want to read!</p> <p>Because it might be hard to find specific books these days, we are not having a theme for our May meeting, so you do not need to bring any suggestions to this April meeting. We will still meet for May, and still have books to read, but it will just be a little different.</p> <p>I'm looking forward to this video chat! Here are our books for April (2020 Adaptations):</p> <p>Tiny Pretty Things by Sona Charaipotra and Dhonielle Clayton<br/>(This book has an upcoming Netflix adaptation.)</p> <p>How far is too far?</p> <p>At one of Manhattan's most elite ballet schools, wafer-thin ballerinas pull their hair into sleek buns and lace their pointe shoes high, waiting for their chance to shine. But beneath the pretty, polished surface, these girls are hiding some terrible secrets and telling some twisted lies.</p> <p>Privileged Bette is tiny and beautiful\u2014like a ballerina in a music box. But living forever in the shadow of her ballet-star sister and under the weight of family expectations brings out a dangerous edge in her.</p> <p>Perfectionist June can turn a flawless pli\u00e9 and diligently keeps her weight below 100 pounds. But she's never landed a lead role. Tired of always being the understudy, this year she'll settle for nothing but the best\u2014even if she must resort to some less-than-perfect means to get there.</p> <p>And new girl Gigi isn't your traditional ballerina. A free-spirited California girl, she's not used to the fierce competition. Still, that doesn't stop her from outperforming every dancer in the school. But even she is hiding a ticking time bomb, and the very act of dancing just might expose her secrets to everyone.</p> <p>Being a prima isn't all satin and lace; sometimes you have to play dirty. With the competition growing fiercer with every performance, and harmless pranks growing ever darker, it's only a matter of time before one small spark ignites . . . and even the best get burned.</p> <p>Opposite of Always by Justin A. Reynolds<br/>(A movie adaptation of this book is \"In Development.\")</p> <p>When Jack and Kate meet at a party, bonding until sunrise over their mutual love of Froot Loops and their favorite flicks, Jack knows he\u2019s falling\u2014hard. Soon she\u2019s meeting his best friends, Jillian and Franny, and Kate wins them over as easily as she did Jack.</p> <p>But then Kate dies. And their story should end there.</p> <p>Yet Kate\u2019s death sends Jack back to the beginning, the moment they first meet, and Kate\u2019s there again. Healthy, happy, and charming as ever. Jack isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s losing his mind.</p> <p>Still, if he has a chance to prevent Kate\u2019s death, he\u2019ll take it. Even if that means believing in time travel. However, Jack will learn that his actions are not without consequences. And when one choice turns deadly for someone else close to him, he has to figure out what he\u2019s willing to do to save the people he loves.</p> <p>Tower of Dawn &amp; Kingdom of Ash (Throne of Glass #6 &amp; 7) by Sarah J. Maas</p> <p>I am not going to include a synopsis here in case of spoilers.</p>",

Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from \"the good fight\", For Whom the Bell Tolls.<br/>The story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain, it tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. In his portrayal of Jordan's love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of El Sordo's last stand, in his brilliant travesty of La Pasionaria and his unwillingness to believe in blind faith, Hemingway surpasses his achievement in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms to create a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving, and wise.</p> <p>\"If the function of a writer is to reveal reality,\" Maxwell Perkins wrote Hemingway after reading the manuscript, \"no one ever so completely performed it.\" Greater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author's previous works, it stands as one of the best war novels of all time.</p>",

Here\u2019s the Zoom info:</p> <p>Time: Apr 22,[masked]:00 PM Central Time (US and Canada)</p> <p>Join Zoom Meeting<br/><a href=\"https://umn.zoom.us/j/92201923150\" class=\"linkified\">https://umn.zoom.us/j/92201923150</a></p> <p>Meeting ID:[masked]</p> <p>Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.</p> <p>From Goodreads.com:</p> <p>\u201c In the tradition of The Paris Wife and Mrs. Poe, The Other Einstein offers us a window into a brilliant, fascinating woman whose light was lost in Einstein's enormous shadow. It is the story of Einstein's wife, a brilliant physicist in her own right, whose contribution to the special theory of relativity is hotly debated and may have been inspired by her own profound and very personal insight.</p> <p>Mitza Maric has always been a little different from other girls. Most twenty-year-olds are wives by now, not studying physics at an elite Zurich university with only male students trying to outdo her clever calculations. But Mitza is smart enough to know that, for her, math is an easier path than marriage. And then fellow student Albert Einstein takes an interest in her, and the world turns sideways. Theirs becomes a partnership of the mind and of the heart, but there might not be room for more than one genius in a marriage.\u201d</p>",
